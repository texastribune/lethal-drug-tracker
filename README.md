# Data Visuals Kit

I don't know if this will be the final resting place for this, but it needs somewhere to live.

## Quickstart

Run these commands to create your project's folder:

```sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/texastribune/idv-kit.git <name-of-project>
cd <name-of-project> && rm -rf .git
```

Next, `npm install`.

Now, get to work!
