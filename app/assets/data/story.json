Texas refused, and the state Legislature <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2015/05/19/bill-making-execution-drug-providers-secret-passes/\">passed a law in 2015</a> to maintain the privacy of any person involved in an execution, from the person who inserts the needle to the one who sells the drug."
