# Lethal Injection Drugs in Texas

The Texas Tribune's project tracking the state's supply of lethal injection drugs.

This project was produced and maintained by [Jolie McCullough](https://github.com/joliesky) using the Texas Tribune's Data Visuals kit.

**Note:** This project was sunsetted on September 2023. The data was collected through continuous open records requests and updated by [Jolie McCullough](https://github.com/joliesky) through [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZaLM3eoUgLb-4tJCu66fbjQtNZPTL1mueTKfFtb-tgk/edit). The final data update was done on June 30, 2023.

The project also uses an old version of node. I was able to update and deploy using `node version v8.16.0`. 

## Quickstart

_Please note - some static assets required to make this project work are only accessible to Texas Tribune developers._

Clone the project, then run `npm install`. Then pull down the assets with `npm run assets:pull`, and the data with `npm run data:fetch`. Use `npm run serve` to run the local development server.

Now, get to work!
